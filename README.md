# Elevation Tool
## Please consult the 3700_Final_Demo.pdf file for more detailed information, with pictures included. I have included test inputs and outputs in my project submission. The elevation tool is a script that allows you to input your elevation raster, and in one step, output hillshade, slope, aspect, and contour files into one   convenient place.

## Before using, make sure to download the script (toolscript.py) as well as the toolbox (default.atbx). Open a project that has a map and an elevation raster (.tif), and import the folder that contains the toolbox and script.
## Open the script properties if you need to change any part of the tool script. Everything is set to the typical default as though you used each operation individually. You can also change the contour interval via the script.

## It will ask for a single input and you should put an elevation raster there. For an output, put a folder for where you would like the outputs to go. Run the tool, and it will take a few minutes to produce the outputs.
## The outputs will all appear in the folder you set as the output. I recommend you choose one that is connected to your project, so you can use the data immediately.

## You will receive three .tif files and one .shp file to be accessed in ArcPro. The contour file is the .shp one. Update symbology and display as needed; no changes are made to symbology in the tool.
